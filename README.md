# Jitterpaint

A silly little drawing program that likes to jitter. Paint and export to GIF.
![An example][example]

**BUILT AROUND THE GAMEPAD API! Designed for use with a wired Xbox 360 controller.**

[_Try it out now._][1]

## Plans:
- Mash seven JavaScript files into one
- Replace lineTo() drawing between each point on the canvas with arcTo() or, god forbid, quadraticCurveTo()
